This app takes in orders from customers and subtracts from the store's total supplies.

The app first will display a list of all of the available products, current stock, and their costs.

The table is broken up into 4 columns and the are: item_id, product_name, department_name price, stock_quantity

The app asks the following things from the user.

product ID
quantity the user wants to purchase

The app will show the stock before your purchase, what item you choose, how qunatity, and the item cost.

Then it will show the total cost and ask if you want to purchase another item.

# It must be ran in the terminal.
